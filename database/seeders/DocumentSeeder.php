The findings underscore the importance of autocratic leadership in the loan recovery process, suggesting that leaders with unilateral decision-making authority can enhance the effectiveness of managing defaults.

With data from 291 U.S. remote workers, findings reveal that cognitive and relational crafting behaviors have differing impacts on technology perception. Cognitive crafting adds complexity, reducing perceived ease of use and usefulness, while relational crafting enhances perceived usefulness. Task crafting contributes positively to both perceived ease of use and usefulness.
